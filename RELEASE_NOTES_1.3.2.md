# OC Remote v1.3.2 — Release Notes

Patch release focused on session management quality-of-life and agent mode reliability.

## Highlights

- Added multi-select mode in the sessions list: long-press to select sessions, select all, and delete selected sessions in batch.
- Improved selection-mode UX polish with clearer visual states and smoother transition behavior.
- Fixed agent mode persistence mismatch so the selected Plan/Build agent stays consistent between UI state and outgoing commands.

## Version

- `versionName`: `1.3.2`
- `versionCode`: `10`
